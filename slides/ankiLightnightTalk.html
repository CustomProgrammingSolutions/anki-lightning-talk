# Rote memorization

In a previous talk by Michael Milewski we saw a bunch of different vi commands.

How would we effectively memorize them? Or something like useful information about Python?

???
Vi has a lot of commands, the huge number of commands is one of the things that makes it so powerful but also one of the things that makes it have a hard learning curve.
Reducing that learning curve is a crucial part of getting people started with complex software like vi.

# Flashcards

???
This is a study technique that's been around for a long time.

# So why aren't these more popular

- Time consuming to create
- Large amount of time spent on sorting or cards get repeated 
- Heavy! (I have a LOT of cards)
- Annoying to update

# Anki

Anki helps you:

- Make flashcards effectively
- Sync flashcards across devices
- Schedule when the cards come up for study (this is the real "superpower")
      
???
      
Flash cards are far easier to utilize effectively with computers.
The storage of large decks of cards for study is unwieldly, I have hundreds of cards across my study decks and this would be hard to manage on paper-cards.

Being able to access my study decks on all my devices makes it much easier for me to actually study.
This extra convienence is large as it makes it easier to get started studying each time and hence more likely for me to do it.
